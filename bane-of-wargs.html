    <p>What is BANE OF WARGS?</p>
	<p>Bane Of Wargs is a game engine that you can use to create any story, item, mount, weapon, village or anything you can imagine. It is free, and open-source, and you can fork the game engine and tweak as you would like, to make it like you'd like!</p>
	<p>You have the ability to create mods/plugins that you can load in the main menu and the mod content will overwrite the vanilla content, which make you able to totally modify the story of the base game.</p>
	<p>You can find the game repository at <a href="https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs" target="_blank">https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs</a></p>
