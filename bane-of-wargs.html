    <p>What is BANE OF WARGS?</p>
	<p>Bane Of Wargs is a game engine that you can use to create any story, item, mount, weapon, village or anything you can imagine. It is free, and open-source, and you can fork the game engine and tweak as you would like, to make it like you'd like!</p>
	<p>You have the ability to create mods/plugins that you can load in the main menu and the mod content will overwrite the vanilla content, which make you able to totally modify the story of the base game.</p>
	<p>You can find the game repository at <a href="https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs" target="_blank">https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs</a></p>

	<p class="dialog">pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
	<p class="dialog">python source/main.py</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The vanilla plot begins like this:</p>
	<p class="dialog">“ You're a lumberjack who lives in a small village in the Forlindon Woods, a quiet a calm place to live. You've always wondered what's after this quiet forest because your little village is a small town that lives apart from the other great cities in the Stall Insland. You've heard some stories and tales about the rest of the world. Only some words come to your mind when you hear "the world": dragons, gold, elves, dwarves, great mountains, adventure... One day that starts like any other, you get a message in your mailbox: a dwarf king from the Goro Mountains Peaks has heard from the mayor of the village, who keeps contact with him because they provide the village in stone, that you have great woodcraft skills. This dwarf king requests you to come to his castle in the mountains of the Goro Peaks to participate to a great project... You decide to accept the deal, because of the great promiced remuneration. You'll travel into many places like the Californ Woods, the Stall Fields, and many other great places. ”</p>
