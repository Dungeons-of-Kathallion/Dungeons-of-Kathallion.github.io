    <p>If you want to play Dungeons of Kathallion, but don't know enough Python to figure it out, then you need to read this page:</p>
    <p>First, open your favorite terminal. Or just the terminal on your computer. You need to download Dungeons of Kathallion now. You can do that by cloning it onto your computer through the terminal, or you can download. If you want to clone through terminal, run this line:</p>
    <p class="dialog">git clone git@github.com:Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Dungeons-of-Kathallion.git</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you can download Dungeons of Kathallion from <a href="https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Dungeons-of-Kathallion">GitHub</a> or right here: <a href="Dungeons-of-Kathallion.zip">Dungeons-of-Kathallion.zip</a></p>
    <p>Now, one important thing is the path to Dungeons of Kathallion. You can set where it is before you use "git clone" by running this command before you run the "git clone":
    <p class="dialog">cd path/to/where/you/want/the/file</p>
    <p>Or you can move the download file somewhere else by simply dragging and dropping it! Now that Dungeons-of-Kathallion is where you want it, you must use the "cd" command to go inside the Dungeons of Kathallion folder. (The path should end with "Dungeons-of-Kathallion/")</p>
    <p>You're almost ready to play! Now you just have to make sure your computer has Python 3 and Pip, then run this command:</p>
    <p class="dialog">pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
    <p>Now, finally, you can play with one more command:</p>
    <p class="dialog">python main.py</p>
